# font

The `font` directory contains the web font files bundled with the theme.

The `hgnm` font provides a small number of icon glyphs used in the theme:

  - `download`
  - `facebook`
  - `left-arrow-bold`
  - `link-ext`
  - `location`
  - `right-arrow-bold`

Use these with [the `icon` component][icon].

If you follow [the set-up directions][su], additional fonts will be downloaded.

[icon]: ../components/icon.php
[su]: ../README.md#development
